# About this project
## Context
The C-level has some ad-hoc requirements, so I use SQL to "communicate" with the database, transform and filter data by using aggregating and filtering functions to get the necessary metrics, to meet those requirements.
About the database, that is an eCommerce company's dataset. It includes all data regarding user transactions upon visiting the website, clicking the next page, adding to the cart, and purchasing orders.

## Content
It has 8 SQL queries, corresponding to 8 ad-hoc requirements of C-level.
Those requirements are relevant to conversion rate (pageView to add_to_cart and finally purchase), Sales performance, and Cohort map.
